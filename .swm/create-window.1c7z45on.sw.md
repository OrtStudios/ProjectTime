### ðŸ“„ ProjectTime/lib/main.dart
```dart
22         WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
23         windowManager.ensureInitialized();
```

<br/>

we wait until the window has initialized and then we run the app with the Flutter "runApp" function.

### ðŸ“„ ProjectTime/lib/main.dart
```dart
29         windowManager.waitUntilReadyToShow().then(
30             (_) async 
31             {
32             // await windowManager.setTitleBarStyle(TitleBarStyle.hidden);
33                 await windowManager.setAsFrameless();
34                 await windowManager.setHasShadow(false);
35                 windowManager.show();
36             }
37         );
```

<br/>

setting the window properties:

*   _size -> see in_ `config.dart`
    
*   title -> "Project Time"
    
*   minSize and maxSize are the same and to be seen in `config.dart`
    
*   alignment -> center
    
    at the end we show the window
